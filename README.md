`puppeteer-utilz` is a package with utility functions for [puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer) that provides a low and high abstraction tooling to standardize the way we build projects using puppeteer, making our code more **stable**, **clean**, and **efficient**.

If you have any use cases which you think can be modular enough, please check [contributing.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) PRs are welcome!

## Getting started 🔧

`puppeteer-utilz` is hosted on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/puppeteer-utilz), so you can install it with:

`npm install puppeteer-utilz --save`

And for the yarn fans:

`yarn add puppeteer-utilz --save`
